## Project Overview
Our project is a recipe suggestion tool designed to help users make the most of the ingredients they already have in their kitchen.  Users can select ingredients they may have in their kitchen and our tool will suggest recipes to them that they could make with said ingredients. Our tool provides recipe details, as well as recipe history, giving the user not only the instructions to make a meal without having to run to the grocery store, but also fun facts about the meal to share around the dinner table. In addition to these search features, our tool includes summary search analytics, showcasing summary statistics of searches made by all users. 

## Project Architecture

- **Microservice:** Build a microservice that interfaces with a data pipeline. You can choose Python or Rust for development. The microservice should include logging and be containerized using the Distroless Docker image. A Dockerfile must be included in your repository
- **Data Engineering:** Your project should involve the use of a library specializing in data engineering such as Spark, Pandas, SQL, a vector database, or any other relevant library.
- **Infastructure as Code (IaC):** Your project must utilize an IaC solution for infrastructure setup and management. You can choose among AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM, AWS CDK, or the Serverless Framework.
- **API Usage:** This project utilizes the Edamam recipe API, which supplied the recipe details and images based on the user selected ingredients. The Amazon Bedrock LLM API was used to return history of the recipe selected by the user. 
  
## Load Test & Quantitative Assessment
Load testing of our application was conducted using the ```Locust``` package. We were interested in seeing the performance of our tool under varying levels of user demand, with specific interest in the ability to handle 10,000 requests per second. Our testing yielded the following results:
